# timing-system
Components for a micromouse and line follower contest timing system.

Initial development will be related to a drag race timer. 

The contest is described here: https://ukmars.org/contests/drag-race/

And the rules are here: https://ukmars.org/contests/contest-rules/drag-race/

The `legacy` folder contains design files for the existing equipment used in UK contests at Birmingham City University and originally designed by Tony Wilcox.
